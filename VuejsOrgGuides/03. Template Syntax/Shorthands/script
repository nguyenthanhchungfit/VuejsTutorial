The v- prefix serves as a visual cue for identifying Vue-specific attributes in your templates. 
    This is useful when you are using Vue.js to apply dynamic behavior to some existing markup, but can feel verbose for some frequently used directives. 
    At the same time, the need for the v- prefix becomes less important when you are building a SPA, where Vue manages every template. 
    Therefore, Vue provides special shorthands for two of the most often used directives, v-bind and v-on:

    v-bind Shorthand
        <!-- full syntax -->
        <a v-bind:href="url"> ... </a>

        <!-- shorthand -->
        <a :href="url"> ... </a>

        <!-- shorthand with dynamic argument (2.6.0+) -->
        <a :[key]="url"> ... </a>
    
    v-on Shorthand
        <!-- full syntax -->
        <a v-on:click="doSomething"> ... </a>

        <!-- shorthand -->
        <a @click="doSomething"> ... </a>

        <!-- shorthand with dynamic argument (2.6.0+) -->
        <a @[event]="doSomething"> ... </a>
